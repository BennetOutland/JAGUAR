## Abstract 

The control of both cooperative and non-cooperative multi-agent systems have applications across many different domains which can all be modeled using differential games. However, there have been computational intractability in quickly solving these problems on moderate hardware. In this work, we propose a novel method for solving difficult, non-convex differential games through a hybridization of kinodynamic motion planning and solving iterative linear-quadratic game approximations. Game-informed motion planning is used to rapidly determine feasible game solution trajectories while iterative linear-quadratic game approximations are then used for further refinement and multi-agent coupling. We name this algorithm framework JAGUAR: Joint Agent Game-theoretic Update with Augmented Roadmap-planning. For numerical examples, we study a problem between an evader and pursuer inspired by the homicidal chauffeur problem in the presence of convex polygon obstacles.
